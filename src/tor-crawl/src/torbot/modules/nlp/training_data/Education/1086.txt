theory arrive inductive reasoning deductive reasoning strict framework logic idea refer theory simple confusion meaning word public astrophysicist use word theory word hypothesis determine scientific idea model hypothesis theory put dinosaur puzzle analogy solve board puzzle helpful clarify distinction theory hypothesis puzzle piece possible candidate fill open space puzzle puzzle piece consider possible hypothesis try puzzle piece piece appear fit side puzzle point tempting upgrade status puzzle piece good hypothesis theory actually puzzle piece hypothesis caution need evidence come case board puzzle piece fit occasionally piece think fit match hypothesis reject piece prove fit side confident piece fit puzzle way multiple distinct logical argument base factual evidence upgrade hypothesis status call theory finally similar board puzzle piece correct theory fit base knowledge fit surround evidence hypothesis fit fact theory allow big picture sense evidence surround theory important idea science allow significance random information wrong sherlock holmes type deductive reasoning statement possible hypothesis eliminate hypothesis matter unlikely correct hypothesis deductive reasoning draw conclusion complete certainty tempting believe deductive reasoning fact inductive reasoning fictional sherlock holmes make mistake rarely reasoning concern nature consider deductive reasoning problem imply possible hypothesis identify fact know nature secret important conduct experiment collect field datum verify logic experiment learn nature secret add base knowledge inductive reasoning draw conclusion complete certainty generally helpful deductive reasoning inductive reasoning allow reach conclusion directly observe base observe inductive reasoning allow geologist use present observation draw conclusion event happen million year ago earth distant past inductive reason allow use observation past anticipate probable event future example day bus stop bench pm sit bench minute expect bus arrive minute notice inductive reasoning correct vast majority time guarantee true matter consistent bus complete certainty bus day predict time attempt solve problem like consider reasonable hypothesis believe identify possibility equivalent state limited imagination scientific theory arrive inductive reasoning true prove put dinosaur puzzle yes follow strict rule logic claim matter argument appear confirm theory technically possibility wrong realistic term sound argument lead agreement conceptual model odd theory wrong extremely small practical purpose answer refer board puzzle example let piece appear fit match second finally side fit puzzle puzzle piece seamlessly fit puzzle bit ridiculous continue argue belong happen theory new evidence lead slight important modification theory biologist test theory evolution know chance overturn theory evolution effectively nil scientist continue experiment hope gain deep understanding evolution work example darwin favor call gradualism evolution suggest birth new specie come gradual separation original recent evidence show far common new specie evolve small isolated population later quickly displace large population punctuate equilibrium form evolution fossil evidence tend abrupt change specie gradual separation suggest modification darwin original idea certainly overthrow evolution theory important improvement understand process work example scientific theory put dinosaur puzzle copernican heliocentric model solar system good example guideline scientific theory purpose provide simple explanation movement planet nicolaus copernicus suggest sun earth center think universe strong point copernican model give logical explanation phase moon apparent retrograde motion mars see earth like scientific truth unsette people think earth center universe evidence need accept point copernican model consider strong hypothesis theory later philosopher giordano bruno promote merit europe scientist galileo galilei johannes kepler provide additional evidence need raise status idea theory kepler precise datum astronomer tycho brahe discover planet ellipse sun focus powerful argument sun earth center galileo contribution come construct telescope new technology record observation telescope observe mountain surface moon additional moon orbit jupiter phase venus sunspot sun present observation support heliocentric model solar system publication dialogue concern chief world systems put dinosaur puzzle independently collectively argument base inductive reasoning prove sun center solar system take collectively effectively impossible argument lead conclusion correct conclusion argument like puzzle piece argument help disprove hypothesis fit mismatch puzzle piece argument support conclusion increasingly ridiculous argue conclusion correct hypothesis pass test classify scientific theory strong independent argument base sound evidence support conclusion theory evolution true scientific theory theory evolution true scientific theory pass test have independent argument base evidence lead conclusion furthermore theory evolution demonstrate ability powerful tool make sense evidence surround theory evolution prove important scientific theory theory evolution true scientific theory controversy believe open new idea reality people unwilling adjust fundamental belief people theory evolution affront belief human being uniquely gift apart specie planet scientific evidence support belief endow ancestral lineage separate specie truth upset people ignore overwhelming evidence belief close mind overwhelming evidence envision theory evolution hypothesis remain hope defeat attack evolution time distort truth intention promote well science instead fulfill wishful agenda constructive criticism welcome seek improvement clear critic evolution promote anti science philosophy damaging success civilization good science seek truth reality regardless make feel human nature self center willing listen feel important scientist human upset truth discover successful interact reality need maturity accept truth center universe earth thousand year old human being uniquely create specie general rule helpful determine truth argument place center attention likely deceive play human need feel important certain wrong fight human weakness maturity well able wise
